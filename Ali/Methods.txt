in our study, we will use machine learning algorithms to classify the patients with real Alzheimer disease and similar symptoms. The data set we are going to use is the ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative). The methods that we will use in this study will include Ensemble Learning techniques, random forests, Artificial Neural Networks, etc. to gain higher accuracy. The different algorithms will be used for different data sets. For example, to use MRI images as training data we will use Convolution Neural Networks, for EEG data we will use Recurrent Neural Networks, and for parametric data (like the PH of blood, age, blood pressure, etc.) the support vector classifier, decision tree, stochastic gradient descent will be used as ensemble learning method. The last but not least, a statistical analysis will be done on the predictions of the machine, to suggest the best treatment guideline
