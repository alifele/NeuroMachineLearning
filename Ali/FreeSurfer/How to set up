after installation you need to setup the env. for the freesurfer.


for example suppose that I have installed the freesurfer in the following directory : /home/ali/Programms


to set the env, every time that you open a terminal to use the freesurfer you should write these two lines in terminal:
'''
export FREESURFER_HOME=/home/ali/Programms/freesurfer
source $FREESURFER_HOME/SetUpFreeSurfer.sh
'''


but if you want not to write these two lines every time you can add it to the .bashrc file:
Open the terminal and write:
'''
gedit ~/.bashrc
'''

and then add the mentioned lines to the end of that file and then save it.

if you do the steps successfully you should see this massage at every startup of terminal:

Setting up environment for FreeSurfer/FS-FAST (and FSL)
FREESURFER_HOME /usr/local/freesurfer
FSFAST_HOME     /usr/local/freesurfer/fsfast
FSF_OUTPUT_FORMAT nii
SUBJECTS_DIR    /usr/local/freesurfer/subjects
MNI_DIR         /usr/local/freesurfer/mni
